						<h2>Life Before Death.</h2>
						<p>
							Hello there! Iâ€™m Ian, as you might have noticed. I am a married Computer
							Engineer and Applied Mathematician from Ohio. I have a cat named Daenerys, and a Shiba
							Inu named Kibo. In my free time, I like to dabble in machine learning, stretch my wings
							in projects programmed in Python, and experiment with electronics and hardware. I also enjoy
							model building, cooking, and playing cooperative video games.
							<br><br>
							I speak basic conversational Japanese, and am fluent in more than 5 programming languages
							as well. I enjoy working with teams of people to create innovative solutions which incorporate
							the latest technology with practical function and ease of use. In my work, I have created both
							back end and customer facing products, which have helped bring companies to the cutting edge
							of technology, improving their work lives and their reporting abilities. I am a self starter,
							enjoy tackling unique projects which require creative solutions, and I am always looking for
							opprotunities to grow.

								<h3>Travel</h3>
								<p>
									Whether for work or play, travel is constant in my life. There are
									so many cultures, cuisines, people in this big world of ours that I can't
									help but be excited to experience it all. In 2018, I traveled to England
									and France for vacation, a trip that left me wanting to explore more of
									Europe and Scandinavia. For work, I frequently travel to China, India,

									laughing as we play <i>League of Legends</i> as a full team, I love every
									minute of being close to those I care about most in my favorite hobby.
